            Review the PR diff provided in context. Focus on:
            1. Correctness bugs: off-by-one errors, wrong variables, division errors
            2. Null safety: missing None/null checks before method calls
            3. Business logic: rating factors, premium calculations, risk scoring
            5. Security: no hardcoded secrets, proper input validation

            Use the diff already provided — read source files for additional context if needed.
            Output a structured review with file:line references and suggested fixes.
            Use: 🔴 Critical (must fix), 🟡 Warning (should fix), 🟢 Suggestion (nice to have)
